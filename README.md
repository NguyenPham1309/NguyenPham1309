## 🗣️ About Me

With experience in the E-commerce and Life insurance industries, including Business Development, Sales Activation, and Planning, I had the opportunity to leverage my 4 years of business acumen to initially facilitate data-driven decision-making through data reporting. Following my passion for solving business challenges and creating effective decision-making processes, I transitioned into the data world as a data analyst and project manager. I am honing my data manipulation and database management skills, with a business-driven mindset, to contribute to a consolidated data effort that supports business growth.
